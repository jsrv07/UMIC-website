    <h1>Team AeRoVe</h1>
    <p>Team AeRoVe of UMIC is on a never-ending pursuit of developing an ultimate system of autonomous fixed-wing as well as
    multirotor aircraft.<br><br><br> Incorporating different subsystems namely ‘Mechatronics’, ‘Controls’, ‘Machine Learning’,
    ‘Perception’, ‘Path Planning’, and ‘Localisation’, the team emphatically covers every aspect to forge a de rigueur
    system of autonomous aerial vehicles.</p>

            <h3>The Mothership Drone</h3>
            <p>Primary drone that carries the secondary daughter drone.<br><br>An autonomous 25 Kg hexacopter with
            an integral cage-like structure. <br><br> The mothership will deploy the daughter drone at the mast and continue its way homeward
            to complete the mission in 9 minutes.</p>

            <h3>The Daughter Drone</h3>
            <p>The daughter drone, a 25 kg autonomous coaxial-octocopter capable of launching in mid-air, is meant to replace the
            communication module.<br><br> It is equipped with a Pixhawk 4 for controlling the drone during flight. Intel Realsense D435 for
            obtaining live video feed of the surroundings, Intel NUC 5i5RYH onboard computation, Here3 GPS for localisation, and 7
            DOF robotic arm for gripping the mast and replacing the module.</p>

        <div class="coursecol">
            <h3>The Gripper</h3>
            <p>The replacement mechanism is attached to the daughter drone and is the most integral component of the design. <br><br>It
            consists of two grippers- one meant for holding on to the mast and the other for removing the module- each with two
            degrees of freedom.<br><br> Made with a lightweight yet sturdy material to reduce load on daughter drone.</p>

            <h3>Gripper mechanism</h3>
            <p><b>Maneuvers for module replacement:</b><br><br>
                The first step comprises lowering the gripper and grabbing the swaying mast, thus ceasing any relative motion between
                the gripping mechanism and the mast.<br><br>
                Next, the communication module is extracted from the mast by employing a specially designed gripper which will slide
                onto the module’s antenna and pull it out using a linear actuator. As soon as the module loses contact with the guiding
                rods, it will fall automatically<br><br>
                Now the replacement module can be slid into place, completing the process of module replacement.
